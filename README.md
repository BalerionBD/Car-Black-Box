**Car Black Box with Microcontroller:**

A Car Black Box, implemented on a microcontroller, serves as an onboard data recorder capturing vital vehicle metrics in real-time. This program logs data like speed, acceleration, and GPS coordinates, offering insights for accident reconstruction and driver behavior analysis.

**How It Works:**

1. **Data Acquisition:**
   - The microcontroller interfaces with vehicle sensors to gather real-time data.
   - Sensors measure parameters like speed, acceleration, GPS coordinates, and potentially other metrics depending on the setup.

2. **Data Logging:**
   - Collected data is stored locally on the microcontroller's memory or an external storage device.
   - Timestamps are associated with each data point for chronological analysis.

3. **Data Retrieval:**
   - Users can retrieve logged data either directly from the microcontroller or by connecting it to a computer.
   - The program may provide options for data visualization and analysis, facilitating insights into driving patterns and events.

**Instructions:**

**1. Compilation:**
   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/car-black-box.git`
   - Navigate to the project directory: `cd car-black-box`
   - Compile the code for your specific microcontroller platform.

**2. Installation:**
   - Install the necessary libraries and dependencies as outlined in the README file.
   - Connect the microcontroller to the vehicle's OBD-II port or relevant sensors.

**3. Usage:**
   - Start the program on the microcontroller to begin data logging.
   - Retrieve logged data using the provided instructions.
   - Analyze the data for insights into vehicle performance and driver behavior.

**Example:**
   - Connect the microcontroller to the vehicle's sensors and power supply.
   - Start the program using the specified commands or configuration.
   - Retrieve logged data periodically for analysis or in the event of an incident.

**Notes:**
- Ensure compatibility with your microcontroller model and vehicle sensors.
- Customize the program to include additional features or metrics based on specific requirements.
- Follow best practices for data security and privacy, especially when handling sensitive vehicle data.

This Car Black Box implementation offers a valuable tool for monitoring and analyzing vehicle performance and driver behavior. Contributions and feedback are welcome for further enhancement and optimization.
